* Then, extract the Archive.  
* Run `init_user` first, to create your account.

## Using as a Client
### Cubes
A "Cube" (or Server) represents a chat room.  
Upon launching the Client, you'll be asked to input the Cube Address.  
This is usually the Server's IP or Hostname (Ask your Admin for Help)
